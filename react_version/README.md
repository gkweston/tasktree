# StarLog
This is a basic demo application for an HCI class.

## Run
Install npm, yarn, etc. then:
```
git clone <this_repo>
cd todo-436
yarn
yarn start
```

Have fun!

## Future additions
1. Look at rounding the cornes of nodes and cleaning up design
2. Add a simple animation when nodes are completed
3. Add a demo .gif to the readme

## Current bugs:
* If a node has children and you complete it, score only updates for one
* Drag n drop doesn't work properly
* Part of the first task is occluded by the animation box on the score counter
