Future additions
	Look at rounding the cornes of nodes and cleaning up design
	Add a simple animation when nodes are completed

Current bugs:
	If a node has children and you complete it, score only updates for one
	Drag n drop doesn't work properly
	Part of the first task is occluded by the animation box on the score counter
